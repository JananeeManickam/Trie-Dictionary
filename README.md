# Trie-Dictionary
This is a Basic Dictionary project implementing Trie Data Structures. It also helps user to find similar synonyms for the given word.

ABSTRACTION:
  This abstract provides information about how to implement the concept of dictionary search using Trie data structure and also we will be discussing about another special feature in
  dictionary. We can use a Trie to efficiently store strings and search them. For this package, we will be implementing Trie data structures, in addition to linked list and stack. Using Trie,
  search complexities can be brought to optimal limit and also we can easily print all words in alphabetical order which is not easily possible with hashing.
  We add another field to Trie node, a string which will hold the meaning of a word. While searching for the meaning of the required word, we search for the word in Trie and if the word is
  present, then we return its meaning. The outcome of this project is to find meaning of a given word. Additionally, we will be returning a set of synonyms for
  the given word. This feature helps the user to reduce the time on searching for the synonyms page by page.
